# T59: Finite-to-Infinite Boundary Audit

**Status:** open_formal_target
**Prerequisite for:** S1, Q1, H7, HEF physics applicability claims
**First concrete step:** see §7

## What Is Being Audited

The theorem ladder from T26 through T57 was constructed entirely inside finite
models: finite site sets, finite patch constraint graphs, finite morphism
compositions, finite parity-conflict CSPs, finite holonic networks. Every result
in MATHEMATICAL-INDEPENDENCE-AUDIT.md carries that restriction — explicitly or
implicitly.

The audit asks: which of the core theorems survive when the domain extends to
countably infinite or continuous settings, and which are strictly finite artifacts
that break at the boundary?

This matters because the program's physics claims — spacetime aggregation (S1),
quantum under-finalization (Q1), finality-induced direction (H7), holonic
emergence (HEF) — all require the mathematical machinery to operate over
substrates that are not finite. An infinite lattice of quantum degrees of freedom,
a continuous field configuration, a Lorentzian manifold, a spectral triple: none
of these are finite D1RestrictionSystems. If the key theorems are finite artifacts,
the physics claims cannot borrow them without a separate argument. If they survive,
that survival is the first positive evidence for genuine physics reach.

The audit does not attempt to derive physics. It determines the formal boundary
of each theorem's jurisdiction.

## Theorems in Scope

| Theorem | Finite proof | Physics import risk |
|---|---|---|
| CSP-PO1 | T39 | Signed graphs over infinite vertex sets have different decidability |
| HEF (Holonic Emergence) | T40 | Infinite holonic levels may dissolve finite obstructions via limit constructions |
| TTN (Typed Transport Category) | T41 | Preserved_dims intersection may not be well-defined over infinite site sets |
| PO1 Non-Functor Theorem | T41 | Whether this survives as a lax-functor failure or becomes exact in a limit |
| Path-Dependent Admissibility | T37 | Over infinite networks, path enumeration is unbounded; path-dependence may become undecidable |
| Gluing Obstruction Theorem | T26–T29 | Standard sheaf cohomology generalizes this; does D1's typed classification survive? |
| PO1 Chain Theorem | T34 | Over infinite chains, needs a continuity or limit argument |
| FRP (Finality Reflection Property) | T57 | Depends on finite record access; continuous observer domains may not preserve gap assignment |

Physics-facing claims that depend on these surviving at infinite scale: S1
(colimit over infinitely many observer-local domains), Q1 (D1 semantics over
Hilbert space), H7 (constructor-rule model T18 extended to continuous dynamics),
HEF (infinitely many hierarchical levels).

## Hostile Test Cases

### Continuous functions as patch assignments

**Target:** CSP-PO1, Gluing Obstruction Theorem.

Replace finite Boolean-like patch assignments with real-valued functions
f: U → R on open sets U, with constraints requiring f|_{U ∩ V} to agree.
Ask: does the signed-graph parity criterion still detect the obstruction?

Specific test: the Möbius band with two-open-set cover. The orientation sheaf
has H¹ ≠ 0. Encode orientation assignment as a D1RestrictionSystem patch
constraint and apply T39's signed-graph parity test. If it detects the
obstruction, finite-to-continuous survival is supported. If it produces a false
global section, the parity certificate breaks at the continuum.

### Countably infinite site sets

**Target:** Typed Transport Category (T41).

Extend D1RestrictionSystem to countably infinite site sets. Check whether
_compose_morphisms is still well-defined, preserved_dims intersection is
meaningful for infinitely-indexed dimensions, identity morphisms exist (expected:
yes — the identity function is defined for any set), and associativity holds
(expected: yes — set-intersection and function composition are associative for
arbitrary sets).

Expected verdict: category structure survives because the proofs depend on
algebraic properties of functions and sets, not finiteness. This would make
D1Cat well-defined for countably infinite site sets, separating the category
result from the CSP obstruction-detection machinery.

### Measure-theoretic record access

**Target:** FRP (T57), D1-Field.

Replace finite observer access sets with measurable subsets of a probability
space. Records become measurable functions; access boundaries become
sigma-algebras. Check whether the FRP argument holds — the key lemma ("any
chain witnessing (a,b) in F(V) uses only V-accessible events; since V ⊆ U,
the same chain witnesses (a,b) in F(U)") is set-theoretic and does not require
finiteness. Expected: FRP survives. Check whether the gap assignment G(U) = A(U)
- F(U) remains restriction-closed under measurable-set containment.

### Noncommutative geometry spectral triples

**Target:** S1 (spacetime aggregation), the spacetime-colimit open problem.

Can each observer's finality domain be associated with a noncommutative spectral
triple (A, H, D) — where A is the observer's local finality algebra, H is a
Hilbert space of accessible record states, and D is a Dirac operator encoding
the boundary of causal access? Under what conditions does the direct limit of
this diagram of spectral triples converge to a commutative triple (i.e., classical
spacetime)?

This is the hardest test case and is included as a stated formal target, not an
executable near-term check. Pursuing it requires NCG expertise and is a work item
separate from the rest of this audit. It defines the program's outer frontier for
physics reach.

### Holonic emergence at infinite nesting depth

**Target:** HEF (T40).

In a HolonicNetwork where the number of levels n → ∞, does the cross-level
parity obstruction persist, vanish, or become undecidable? König's lemma is
potentially relevant: if the obstruction is detectable locally in any finite
sub-network, it may propagate to the infinite limit via compactness. If not, the
Holonic Emergence Theorem is strictly finite.

## Success Conditions

A result survives if its proof can be restated without the finiteness assumption
and the restated proof is valid.

| Theorem | Expected verdict | Evidence required |
|---|---|---|
| Category structure (T41) | Survives | Algebraic proof is finiteness-independent; written proof sketch confirming this |
| FRP (T57) | Survives | Set-theoretic argument carries; restated without finite-access assumption |
| Gluing obstruction (T26–T29) | Survives as special case of sheaf H¹ | Formal dictionary from D1 patch language to a topological open cover with structure sheaf |
| CSP-PO1 (T39) | Survives as finite special case | Parity criterion = H¹ = 0 for binary sheaves; typed classification layer is new in both regimes |
| Path-dependent admissibility (T37) | Survives under compactness | For finitely-branching infinite networks; stated as conditional theorem |
| Holonic Emergence Theorem (T40) | Survives under König's lemma | Formally stated and proved, or counterexample found at infinite depth |
| PO1 Non-Functor Theorem (T41) | Survives | No category argument depends on finiteness; functor-failure witness carries |

If all seven survive, the formal core applies to infinite and continuous domains,
and the physics claims can borrow from it with stated dictionary conditions rather
than requiring separate proofs.

If the spectral triple construction additionally works, S1 becomes a formal
target with a defined construction program rather than a speculative claim.

## Failure Conditions

**CSP-PO1 breaks at the continuum.** The parity criterion does not reduce to
sheaf H¹ = 0 for continuous domains, and no replacement is known. The typed
classification framework exists only over finite D1RestrictionSystems. Physics
claims citing PO1 need an independent continuous-domain obstruction argument.

**Holonic emergence breaks at infinite depth.** The obstruction dissolves when
the network has infinitely many levels, because infinite-path accumulation
satisfies all cross-level parity conditions that finite sub-networks obstruct.
Constrains holonic claims to finitely many levels.

**FRP breaks under measure-theoretic access.** A measurable-set observer boundary
admits apparent-order pairs visible in a sub-patch but not in the larger patch,
violating FRP. The gap object G is not restriction-closed in the continuum. T56–T57
gap framework requires modification before applying to physics.

**Spectral triple construction fails.** Direct limit of finality C*-algebras does
not converge, or converges to a noncommutative algebra with no known relation to
classical spacetime. Closes the NCG entry point for S1.

Any failure outcome does not reject the finite results. It tightens the claim:
these are theorems about finite typed projection systems, and their physics
relevance depends on a separate argument not yet made.

## What This Audit Does Not Do

- Prove any physics claim. A positive audit result is a list of surviving theorems
  with stated conditions, not a derivation of spacetime or quantum measurement.
- Replace the open-problems stack (S1, Q1, H7). Those require physics-specific
  constructions on top of whatever the audit establishes.
- Determine whether D1RestrictionSystem has a physical realization.
- Resolve the NCG construction. The spectral triple question is identified as the
  most demanding entry point and stated precisely. Pursuing it is a separate item.

## First Concrete Step

Restate the T41 category theorem without the finiteness assumption and check that
the proof holds.

The T41 proof has two parts: (a) associativity of _compose_morphisms and (b)
unit laws for make_identity. Both invoke algebraic properties of function
composition (associative) and set intersection (associative, identity is
D1_DIMENSIONS). Neither depends on the site set being finite.

Step 1: Write a proof sketch of T41 without assuming sites is a finite set. State
exactly which axioms change. If none, declare D1Cat well-defined for countably
infinite site sets. If some, identify the minimal finiteness assumption required.

Step 2: Apply the same analysis to the FRP proof from T57. The key lemma is
set-theoretic. Confirm it holds for access sets that are measurable subsets of a
sigma-algebra, not just finite lists.

Step 3: State explicitly which theorems in the ladder have finiteness-independent
proofs and which require a new argument for the infinite case. This partitions
the theorem ladder into boundary-free and finite-artifact columns.

No new code required. The output is a two-column classification table that
becomes the governing document for subsequent work in this audit.
